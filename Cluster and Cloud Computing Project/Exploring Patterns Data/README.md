# COMP90024 - Assignment 2

Assignment 2: Australia Social Media Analytics on the Cloud - This project is a part of Cluster and Cloud Computing of University of Melbourne, Semester 1 Academic Year 2023.

## Project Overview

The teams should develop a Cloud-based solution that exploits virtual machines (VMs) on the UniMelb Research Cloud for harvesting and processing Mastodon toots. The teams should produce a solution that can be run (in principle) across any node of the UniMelb Research Cloud to harvest and store social media data and scale up/down as required with the data being harvested, processed and incorporated into the existing (running) CouchDB database. Multiple Mastodon servers can/should be used to support the different scenarios (and to lessen the load on any one Mastodon server). Teams are expected to have multiple instances of this application running on the UniMelb Research Cloud together with an associated CouchDB database containing the amalgamated collection of toots, tweets and SUDO data. The CouchDB setup may be a single node or based on a clustered setup.
