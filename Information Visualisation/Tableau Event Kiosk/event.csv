Melbourne Fringe Festival,Festival,gift,black,"Come outside and have a play, Melbourne. The Melbourne Fringe Festival is back this October, with over 450 events to discover across the city from cutting-edge independent artists.

This October the city is your own art adventure playground, with three weeks of groundbreaking new events, art and bold ideas (and just a dollop of mischief and mayhem) set to bring out the cheeky and artistic spirit of Melbourne. With 20 days of comedy, cabaret, dance, drag, music, and the simply undefinable, there’s something for everyone at Fringe.

This year’s Festival is all about reminding everyone of something that kids innately know: that fun and play can be found around every corner, and rules were made to be broken.","Trades Hall Place
